## Healthcare Data Normalization & ERD Project

### 🧠 Problem
Organize and normalize a messy healthcare dataset to support clean SQL querying and efficient storage.

### 📦 Dataset
Synthetic hospital records including patients, admissions, doctors, medications, and test results.

### 🛠️ Tools & Techniques
SQL (Normalization, ERD, CTEs, Window Functions), Manual Data Modeling, Entity-Relationship Design

### 📊 Key Deliverables
- Normalized data to 3NF (1NF, 2NF, 3NF)
- Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD)
- SQL queries for hospital, patient, doctor, and billing analysis

### ❓ Business Questions Answered
- Which hospitals have the highest billing?
- How many patients were treated by each doctor?
- Which patients had abnormal test results?
- What is the average stay duration and billing per hospital?

### ✅ Summary Insights
- Built relational structure with 6+ tables for scalable querying
- Removed data duplication, transitive dependencies
- Enabled analytical queries with performance-focused design


## SQL Queries
This project includes over 30 structured SQL queries used to analyze hospital operations, patient demographics, test results, and billing data. These queries are available in the [healthcare_analysis_queries.sql](./queries.sql) file.
